## Horiseon Challenge

# Description
Project for week 1 demonstrating knowledge of HTML and condensing CSS.
The purpose of this is to reduce over written elements in the style sheet to 
ensure smooth and quick functionality. To many elements can make things run choppy.
This is also to practice git commands and uploading our 1st project. This also requires 
some fixes to the HTML and ensuring we understand functionality.
